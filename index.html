Re:  2 Year Visiting Faculty Position – Electronic and Time Based Art
<br/><br/>
I am writing to express my interest in the position of a visiting faculty position. As demonstrated by my attached CV, 
I have experience teaching at the college level in both traditional and new media. In support of this my own artistic practice 
incorporates video, net-art, archival arts, creative coding and 3D printing.  <br/><br/>

As an artist I research the relationship between the body and its inanimate surroundings. 
This interest led me to pursue an MFA at SAIC’s Department of Art and Technology Studies. During the 
program I was exposed to 3D printing as well as creative coding. I have developed an interest in impossible 
conversations that question our ability to comprehend the world. This was realized, in among other projects,
 as a series of private conversation with the stars that were then broadcast to outer space using a hacked ham radio. 
 <br/><br/>

My practice incorporates a diverse range of interests that are both literal and figurative. From the private body to outer 
space, from the organic to the fabricated. As a recent immigrant to Chicago, my practice has shifted to include an 
interest in loneliness and the challenge of long distance relationships. The role of technology, and especially the 
Internet, is naturally an integral part of this preoccupation. 
<br/><br/>
During the last semester I developed and taught four sections of a course on digital imaging and web-art at the School
 of the Art Institute of Chicago. This was a freshman class for the Bachelor degree program aimed at the introduction 
 of new types of media as well as the cultural and personal significance of the Internet. Through my teachings, 
 students were familiarized with the idea of internet citizenship and were shown how to be active creators of 
 content and identity rather than passive consumers. During the previous year I assisted students in numerous 
 classes including art history seminars and project-based courses. One of these was a course titled Prehistory 
 of New Media that explored New Media and code art prior to the title's origin in the 1980's. I also assisted a 
 graduate level seminar on experimental approaches to writing in a collaborative setting. 
 <br/><br/>

I consider teaching an intrinsic part of my artistic practice, and this enthusiasm for a love of learning, as well as 
my work experience and academic research, makes me an ideal candidate for the position. My interest lies in finding new 
perspectives through which to look at the world and encouraging a rigorous, informed conversation about these in an academic 
environment. 
<br/><br/>
Thank you in advance for your consideration.
Yours faithfully.
Guy Eytan
